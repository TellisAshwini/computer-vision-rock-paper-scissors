# Computer Vision RPS

Rock paper scissors is a hand game played between two or more people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand `rock`, `paper` and `scissor`. A closed fist signifies a `rock`, a flat hand signifies a `paper`, and a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V signifies `scissor`.
`Paper` covers `rock`, `scissors` cuts `paper` and `rock` hits `scissors`. Hence `paper` beats `rock`, `scissors` beat `paper` and `rock` beats `scissors`. 
The players, start by saying these words aloud “Rock! Paper! Scissors!” and then make one of these 3 shapes in hand simultaneously. Using the above logic the winner is decided.
This is a project from AiCore to build an algorithm to play this game in 5 different milestones using computer vision.
## Milestone 1:
computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors` is a repository is created in the GitHub.
Git is a distributed version control system that manages multiple versions of source code and record them into a repository. GitHub is the cloud-based platform used in this project. It serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository for collaboration.
Bash terminal in the VSCode is a platform used to run all the commands for Git and for running the python script.
Below are some basic commands that we frequently use in the bash terminal.
- ```git clone``` command clones the `hangman` repository in the GitHub to the bash terminal in the local machine.
- ```git add``` and ```git commit``` commands are frequently used to stage changes and commit them to the 'hangman' repository.
- ```git push``` command is used to push the committed changes in the  local repository to the GitHub repository.

## Milestone 2:
Rock, paper, scissors game is played using computer vision. Teachable Machine is used for the computer vision.
Teachable Machine (TM) is an AI experiment by Google. It is a web-based tool that makes it fast and easy to create machine learning models without any expertise or coding accessible to everyone.
Four classes are created `rock`, `paper`, `scissor` and `nothing`.
